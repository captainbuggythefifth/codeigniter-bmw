                            network. He has shown an interest in finance and computer science since
                            his youth and so decided to merge his passions. It was this very passion
                            along with the social revolution, which lead to the founding and
                            development of Binary Wealth Management’s investment network, where users connect, share,
                            trade and invest in the world’s financial markets.<br>
                            <br>
                            Yoni is as passionate about his business, as he is for family, wife plus
                            2 kids, which often results in excessive use of the word awesome, and
                            hi-fives around the office.<br>
                            <br>
                            It’s this young CEO’s vision to disrupt the old banking industry and
                            replace it with a new online transparent and social financial system for
                            the benefit for everyone.<br>
                            <br>
